SUBJECT: Mystery Gooâ„¢ Observation
----
This so-called Goo remains a mystery to all of us, but it was fun to observe it in different places of KSC. We think it liked the jukebox in the Astronaut Complex, but it defenitely did not like the R&D area. Are you sure you do not perform any nasty experiments out there?
